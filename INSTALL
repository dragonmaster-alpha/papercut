--------------------
Papercut NNTP Server - Fork for PHPBB3 Only.
--------------------

For more information on what exactly Papercut is, and what are its main
objectives / intended audience, please read the README file.


Requirements:
-------------

- Python 2.2 (it needs the email module to parse MIME based messages)
- PHPbb 3
- Database server
  - MySQL
- Modules
  - MySQLdb python module (http://sf.net/projects/mysql-python)

- Permission to add a new column to MySQL tables

Step by Step Instructions:
--------------------------

1) Unpack the distribution tarball where you intend to run it from

  $ cd /path/to/where/papercut/will/run
  $ gunzip papercut-X.tar.gz
  $ tar vxf papercut-X.tar
  [lots of stuff shows up on the console]
  $ cd papercut-X

2) Edit the settings.py configuration file

  - Change the 'log_path' variable to point to the appropriate directory on your
    server (i.e. /usr/local/papercut/logs/)

  - Modify the 'nntp_hostname' and 'nntp_port' variables to your appropriate
    server name and port number. (Note: if you want to run Papercut on port 199,
    you may need to be root depending on your system)

  - Finally, change the MySQL related variables so Papercut can connect to the
    appropriate database and get the content of the messages.

3)  You will need to add a new column under the main forum listing table to
    associate the name of a newsgroup to a table name. Since PHPbb3 is totally
    dynamic on the number of forums it can create, we need an extra column to
    prevent problems.

    $ cd /path/to/where/papercut/will/run/
    $ cd storage
    $ less phpbb_mysql_fix.sql
    [read the information contained on the file]
    $ mysql -u username_here -p database_here < phpbb_mysql_fix.sql
    [password will be requested now]

  - Now that the new column was created on the main forum listing table, you
    will need to edit it and enter the name of the newsgroup that you want for
    each forum.  You can use mysqladmin for example.

If you find any problems on this set of instructions, or if the instructions
didn't work out for you, please make the corrections needed.
